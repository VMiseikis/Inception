# Inception

**What is Inception?**

This project aim is to learn to dockerize small web-server infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. 

**Requirements:**
- Pulling ready-made docker images or using DockerHub services is not alowed
- Build your own docker images for [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) services
- Set up docker-network to enable communication between docker images
- Set up communication encryption ([SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)) between a client and server
- Ensure data persistence

# Docker

**What is Docker?**
 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) is a software platform for building applications based on containers: small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another.

**What is a Dockerizing?**

Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.

**What is Docker file?**

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 

**What is Docker Image?**

A [docker image](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-image-vs-container) is an immutable (unchangeable) file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run.

**What is Docker Container?**

A [docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
